          <p className="edText">Through my sociology degree, I engaged in coursework and projects that provided valuable insights into data analysis, technology, and social dynamics. I explored statistical methods and data analysis techniques, laying the groundwork for data-driven decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, I delved into the sociology of technology, examining topics such as digital inequality, online communities, and the impact of technology on social behavior. One notable project involved conducting a comprehensive societal analysis of online discourse surrounding female athletes within social networks. Through qualitative and quantitative research methods, I analyzed patterns, attitudes, and biases to deepen my understanding of gender dynamics in sports media and digital platforms.</p>
